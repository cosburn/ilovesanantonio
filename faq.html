					<p class="question"><strong>What if my voter information doesn’t match my identification?</strong></p>
					<p>
					The address on your identification does NOT have to match your address on your voter registration information. If your name does not exactly match your name on your voter registration information, election officials will review your identification, and if your name is “substantially similar,” you’ll be allowed to vote (but required to submit an affidavit stating you are the same person on the official list of voters).
