					<p class="question"><strong>What is a runoff election?</strong></p>
					<p>
					When no candidate receives a majority of the vote in a race, (50% + 1 vote), the two candidates receiving the most votes will move on to a second election, called a runoff. That’s what we’ll be voting for during early voting (May 30th - June 6th) and Election Day (June 10th). The mayoral race is in a runoff between Ivy Taylor and Ron Nirenberg, and city council districts 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, and 10 are also in runoffs. 
					</p>

				<div class="faq">
					<p class="question"><strong>I didn’t vote in the first election. Can I still vote in the runoff?</strong></p>
					<p>
					Yes! You can vote in the runoff even if you didn’t vote in the May election.
