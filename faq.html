					<p class="question"><strong>What is the primary election?</strong></p>
					<p>
					The March 6th primary election is the first round of voting for the 2018 midterm election. During the primaries, you’ll vote for candidates to represent either the Democratic or Republican party in the November midterm election. Both the primary and general midterm elections will include Federal, State, and County races.  
					</p>
					<p>
					The winner of each race for each party will proceed to the general midterm election in November. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the primary, the two candidates receiving the most votes will advance to a primary runoff on May 22nd. (Voters can vote in a runoff even if they didn’t vote in the primary.)

					<p class="question"><strong>Do I get to choose a Democratic or Republican ballot?</strong></p>
					<p>
					Yes&mdash;you can choose your party ballot when you go to vote. Your party affiliation and voting history don’t matter. When you vote in the general election in November, you don’t have to vote for the same candidates or party.

					<p class="question"><strong>What if my voter information doesn’t match my identification?</strong></p>
					<p>
					The address on your identification does NOT have to match your address on your voter registration information. If your name does not exactly match your name on your voter registration information, election officials will review your identification, and if your name is “substantially similar,” you’ll be allowed to vote (but required to submit an affidavit stating you are the same person on the official list of voters).
