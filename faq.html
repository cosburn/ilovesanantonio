					<p class="question"><strong>What is a runoff election?</strong></p>
					<p>
					When no candidate receives a majority of the vote in a race, (50% + 1 vote), the two candidates receiving the most votes will move on to a second election, called a runoff. That’s what we’ll be voting for during early voting (May 30th - June 6th) and Election Day (June 10th). The mayoral race is in a runoff between Ivy Taylor and Ron Nirenberg, and city council districts 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, and 10 are also in runoffs. 
					</p>

				<div class="faq">
					<p class="question"><strong>I didn’t vote in the first election. Can I still vote in the runoff?</strong></p>
					<p>
					Yes! You can vote in the runoff even if you didn’t vote in the May election.

					The address on your identification does NOT have to match your address on your voter registration information. If your name does not exactly match your name on your voter registration information, election officials will review your identification, and if your name is “substantially similar,” you’ll be allowed to vote (but required to submit an affidavit stating you are the same person on the official list of voters).
